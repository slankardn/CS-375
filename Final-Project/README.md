# Final Project Proposal
I plan to make a mini race track similar to the style of *Top Ride* from *Kirby Air Ride*. 
This would entail one track with multiple turns. As for controls, it would involve the use
of 3 buttons one for left, another for right, and lastly, one to go forward. The game is
also played from a bird’s eye view, or “god’s eye,” where you can see the whole board at 
any given time. At the moment there are no plans for ray tracing. However, there will be 
texture work on the course and player character

## First week, 
I will work on a simple geometric version of the game. Ideally, I would have a cube that
can move and rotate through the use of WASD. Along with that I also want to have a simple
plain act as the background at this point

## Second week, 
The goal is to provide a more detailed background with collision. Along with refinements
of player movement. In other words the early steps of level design

## Third week,
The objective of this week is to change the player's model to that of a car or something
along with adding textures to said model and stage

## Forth week,
This week will be used for polish and any lighting implementation along with presentation work 

For this project, I plan to use Three.js and JavaScript
