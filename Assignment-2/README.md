Assignment 2 - Matrix Stacks

After this project, you should be comfortable with:

* knowing the roles of HTML and JavaScript files and content in developing a WebGL-based application
* including several (provided) JavaScript files that help simplify application organization
* using a MatrixStack to manage transformations to control the position and orientation of geometric objects
* assign values to WebGL shader uniform variables to enable customization and manipulation of geometric objects
* update motion variables to enable animation in a WebGL-based application
* coordinate systems, transformations, and matrix order-of-operations
